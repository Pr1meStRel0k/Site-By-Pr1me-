This repository contains a site for retrieving data.

You can run this code on any server and create a link. When users navigate to it, you'll receive the following data in Dropbox:
IP address
OS
Browser (name and version)
Time
And some other data
For everything to work:
Just run the code and correctly configure the link to which you want to navigate and which one it will redirect to.
I understand the code is crude and not very functional, but as a base, it's very good.
P.S. Use only for good purposes; misuse is prohibited.
